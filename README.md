# Bunco

The objective of this program is to create the snack schedule for the neighborhood Bunco group.  

The program will accept a file with the players' and hosts' names as well as the monthly host schedule.  The program will then assign a snack or drink item to each players to bring each month.  This program should evenly distribute the items among the players.
